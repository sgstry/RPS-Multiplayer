# RPS-Multiplayer

RPS-Multiplayer is a 2-Player game that allows users to play Rock, Paper, Scissors with eachother online.
What's unique about this application is that it is actually built without a middle tier. All state management is implemented using Firebase's NoSQL database. An unlimited number of users can join the game by visiting the link below in their Google Chrome browser, but only two can be logged in at once playing the game. Whenever a player disconnects from the site, users can see that a slot has opened up and begin to login to play. Users may then proceed to talk smack to eachother using the instant messenger, as well as let their Rock, Paper, Scissor skills shine. This application is hosted using Firebase Hosting and is also mobile-compatible.
